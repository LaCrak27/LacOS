# Running the OS
To build the OS using the provided makefile, a linux enviroment is the required, be it native or wsl. 

It should be noted that `make start` and `make bochsdbg` will only work if called from wsl in a windows machine since they open the `.exe`s directly (you can just edit them and remove the `.exe` part on linux).
